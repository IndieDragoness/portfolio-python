## Python Egg Files
A 'Python Egg' is a logical structure embodying the release of a specific version of a Python
project, comprising its code, resources, and metadata. Multiple formats to encode them. A key
principle of a Python Egg is that it should be easily discoverable and importable. That is,
it should be possible for a Python application to easily and efficiently find out what eggs are
present on the system and ensure contents are importable.
